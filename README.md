# Self Driving Car PID Controller

This is a very simple PID controller that controls a self dirving car's steering angle. 

## Writeup
The hyperparameters were tuned manually using multiple trial runs.  
  
The P parameter controls recovering once the car goes off center. If the P value is low, it drifts easily and doesn't go back to center quickly. However if it's high, it tends to overcompensate and has a hard time getting back to center once it drifts.  
The I parameter adds extra bias for if the car has been off center for a while. So when the cumulative error is high for a sustained period, this part of the controller will bring the car back to center.  
The D parameter dictates how sensitive the steeering is if the car is off center. If it's high, it's super sensitive and jitters a lot. However if it's too low it doesn't recover fast enough and the car will drive off the road.
